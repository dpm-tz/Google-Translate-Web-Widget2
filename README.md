If you're working on a project without a domain (like developing locally or using a local server), you can still test and implement translation features. For learning purposes, you can either use a local server (e.g., `localhost`) or a development platform (like GitHub Pages or Netlify) to host your website temporarily without needing a domain.

Here are a couple of solutions:

### 1. **Using Localhost**
If you're developing on your local machine, your site will typically run on `localhost` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:8000` depending on your setup).

Since most services require a publicly accessible URL (domain), **Google Translate** will work on your local server, but translation services like **Weglot** may not work as expected on `localhost` because they require a public domain.

### 2. **Use a Free Temporary Domain**
If you want to use a service that requires a domain but donâ€™t have one yet, consider using a temporary hosting solution with a subdomain. Here are some free options:

- **GitHub Pages**: GitHub allows you to host your static website for free, and you can get a URL like `https://yourusername.github.io/yourprojectname`. [Set up GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to get a temporary URL for testing.
  
- **Netlify**: Netlify offers free hosting with a subdomain like `https://yourprojectname.netlify.app`. You can [deploy your project to Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/) and get a temporary URL for testing.

- **Vercel**: Another option is [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which provides free hosting with a subdomain like `https://yourprojectname.vercel.app`.

### 3. **Use a Free Subdomain Service**
You can also get a free subdomain from services like **Freenom** (e.g., `yourproject.tk` or `yourproject.ml`). This will give you a temporary domain for testing purposes without needing to purchase a real domain.

### Next Steps:
- Choose a free hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
- Deploy your project to that platform to obtain a public URL.
- Use that URL for services like Weglot or other translation tools that require a domain.

If you're just testing locally, Google Translate or similar translation tools should work fine.
